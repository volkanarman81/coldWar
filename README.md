# Arma: Cold War Assault - Remastered

> **Modified version.** This is a fork of the Bohemia Interactive CWR source release with local changes, and is not the original program. See [MODIFICATIONS.md](MODIFICATIONS.md).

This repository holds the engine and game source code (codename *Poseidon*) behind *Arma: Cold War Assault* — the game first released in 2001 as *Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis*. That release launched Bohemia Interactive and began the technology lineage that later grew into Real Virtuality, Arma, and Enfusion. The code has been modernized to C++20, built with CMake and Clang, with cross-platform support for Windows x64 and Linux x64.
Bohemia Interactive is releasing it to the community that has kept this game alive for more than two decades — to study it, build on it, fix it, and create from it. Three things are worth keeping separate:

**Source code (this repository)**

The engine and game executables, licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later with additional terms under Section 7. You may use, study, modify, and redistribute it, provided it stays GPL and you follow those terms.

**The name and brand**

"ARMA", "Operation Flashpoint", and the logos are *not* granted. The trademarks stay with their owners ("ARMA" is Bohemia Interactive's). A fork must be renamed and must not present itself as "Arma" or as an official Bohemia Interactive product.

**Game data (separate)**

Models, textures, sounds, missions, and voices. These are not in this repository and are not GPL; they ship separately under the APL-SA license. A free Demo is available on Steam.

In short: the code is free software, the name is not, and the game data comes separately. This license covers the source code only and grants no rights to the trademarks.


## Quick Start

```sh
cmake --preset win-x64-clang-rwdi
cmake --build build/win-x64-clang-rwdi
```

On GNU/Linux, use the matching `linux-x64-clang-rwdi` preset.

## Layout

- [Apps](apps/README.md) - executable targets
- [Engine](engine/README.md) - engine libraries and Rust Trident tooling
- [Master server tools](mserver/README.md) - Rust service and CLI crates
- [Tests](tests/README.md) - test source trees; CI currently compiles them only
- `cmake/` - presets, toolchains, vcpkg triplets, and overlay ports
- `docker/` - container support for service and runtime environments
- `packages/` - ignored local game data staging area
- `resources/` - application icon resources
- `thirdparty/` - vendored third-party headers and sources

This license does not grant you any right to use "ARMA" or any other Bohemia Interactive trademark.

The [`thirdparty/`](thirdparty) directory is **excluded** from the project's GPL
license: it contains vendored third-party code (glad, the RenderDoc API header)
under their own respective licenses — see [`thirdparty/README.md`](thirdparty/README.md).
Dependencies pulled in via vcpkg ([`vcpkg.json`](vcpkg.json)) likewise remain under
their own licenses.

### Game data / assets — Arma Public License Share Alike (APL-SA)

Game data and assets (models, textures, sounds, missions, etc.) are **not part of
this repository** and are **not** covered by the GPL. They are released separately
by Bohemia Interactive under the **Arma Public License Share Alike (APL-SA)**:

- APL-SA license text: <https://www.bohemia.net/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike>

### Getting game data to run what you build

The compiled binaries need game data to run. You can obtain the **free Demo game
data** on Steam:

- *Arma: Cold War Assault Remastered* Demo on Steam: <https://store.steampowered.com/app/4819000>

The full game data ships with the retail game. Whatever you do with assets is
governed by the APL-SA linked above; whatever you do with this source is governed by
the GPL with additional terms per Section 7 in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
